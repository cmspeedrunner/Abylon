# Abylon
Abylon is a dynamically typed compiled programming language.
Actually, it is transpiled, meaning your Abylon code is translated into C, before then being compiled, this holds it back, but, this is more of a demo then anything until I build my compiler (coming soon)

# Tutorial

## Getting started
To start, make sure you have gcc installed, I am going to update this to add support for any compiler installed by the user.<br>
Make sure that `main.py` is installed, obviously.<br>
<b>(Keep in mind, Abylon requires no dependencies beyond gcc and python, pretty neat)</b><br>
After all these requirements are satisfied, you can start writing your first program, create a file ending with `.abyl` and you're ready!<br>

## Writing your first program
Lets start by doing a simple "Hello World!" in Abylon.<br>
Begin by initialising the `main` function, this is where your code will run, Abylon on,
